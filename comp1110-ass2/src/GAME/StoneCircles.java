//Stone Circles represent circles of stones that players can claim around the island.

// at the end of the game. Stone circles are where resources are placed on the board.
// There are a limited number so players must compete to get them. The Stone Circles class contains
// information about the number and location of stone circles on the board, as well as a method for
// randomly assigning resources as part of game set up.
