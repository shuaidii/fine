//description of class
//The Islands class represents the various islands that make up the game board.
// There are several types of islands, each with its own unique features.
// Players can claim territories on any island they choose, but they must be careful
// not to spread their settlers too thin. The Islands class contains information
// about the point value and position of each island on the Board. The class includes methods
// for checking placement of pieces relating to islands.
